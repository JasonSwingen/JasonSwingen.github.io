                        <p>I'm glad you found me! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Jason Swingen and I have been building and marketing fast, responsive, search-engine-optimized websites for over six years. I grew up in Montana and went to school at MSUM in Moorhead, Minnesota, where I received a double major in Marketing and Management. I now live in Duluth, Minnesota, where I work as an international freelance web developer, web designer, and internet marketer. I specialize in building, optimizing, and marketing websites for small businesses in Minnesota as well as internationally.</p>
