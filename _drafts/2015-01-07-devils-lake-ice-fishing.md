## Devils Lake

Luckily my grandparents have a farm less than 30 miles from Devils Lake, which makes Devils Lake a very convenient location to fish. I have heard great things about the lake and seen it grow tremendously in size over the last decade.

I have only fished Devils Lake one other time in the past and it was during the summer.
