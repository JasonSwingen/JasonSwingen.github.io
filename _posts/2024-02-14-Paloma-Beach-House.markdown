description: Towering in the coconut palms of North Captiva, the Paloma Beach House will serve as your own island resort. From your private ‘Crow’s Nest’ high above the treetops, you will be surrounded by breathtaking views of both the gulf and the bay. Add to that your own ground level, heated pool – with its spirited poolside Tiki bar – and you have everything you need for a resort-style life unique even to North Captiva Island.
task: Provide an elegant website showcasing the features and attractions of this rental beach house on North Captiva Island.
