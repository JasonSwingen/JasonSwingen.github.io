Last year was a slow year for bowhunting for me. I hunted a few sections public land south of Duluth, and only saw a few deer a couple of the times I went out. The only antlers I saw were on a little fork-horn on the last day of the season that didn't get any closer than 100 yards away.

## Apply To Hunt With The Arrowhead Bowhunters Alliance

This year will hopefully be different. I completed all of the requirements for the <a href="http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/">Arrowhead Bowhunters Alliance</a>, and was able to go to the lottery. If you are looking to enter in the Duluth City Hunt, it is a good idea to get started early in the spring to get all of the requirements completed. Below is a list of requirements that you need to complete in order to be entered into the hunt.

1. Complete an approved <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/safety/bowhunter/index.html">Bowhunter Education couse</a>.
2. Pass a <a href="http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/proficiency-test">shooting proficiency test</a>.
3. Register at <a href="http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/"> www.bowhuntersalliance.org</a>
4. Complete the <a href="http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/edit-profile?view=login">Bowhunters Alliance Online Application</a>
5. Write a $25.00 check or money order made payable to the City of Duluth.
6. Complete <a href="http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/downloads/2015%20Application%20Part%202.pdf">Part 2 of the application</a>
7. Send in your application.

If there are more hunters than spots available there will be a lottery. This year there were 383 total applicants (285 were returning hunters and 97 were new). 369 of the hunters have been placed in a DHA.

## DHA 2A

As a new hunter I was unable to get my first or second choices in DHA. I was able to get a spot in <a href="http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/images/dha_maps/DHA2.jpg">DHA 2A</a>, which mainly covers the Magney-Snively Natural Area.

I will be going out to do a little scouting before the season opens to figure out where to put my stand.
