description: This website serves as the dedicated merchandise store for the TVR Car Club North America (TVRCCNA), offering a curated selection of regalia and printed manuals to support TVR enthusiasts. Managed by a club volunteer, the TVRCCNA Merch site operates not for profit but to provide unique items and technical resources "at cost" to members. Its goal is to enhance the enjoyment of the TVR brand while setting realistic expectations regarding delivery times for a small, volunteer-led effort.
task: Shipping issues where causing a headache for the TVR Car Club. New shipping parameters were implemented and products were optimized to simplify shipping options for both customers and staff.
