description: Sutherland CBD was established out of the need and desire to provide individuals with a healthy and safe alternative for dealing with chronic pain, alleviating anxiety, and decreasing depression through CBD oil. With the demand for CBD products present and growing, they created their store to help the expanding population of those interested in CBD find the award-winning brands they can trust.
