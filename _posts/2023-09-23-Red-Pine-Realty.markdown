They also sell homes, cabins, lakeshore, land, acreage, and businesses from Silver Bay, Tofte, Lutsen, Hovland to Grand Portage and everything in between. Situated in our wonderful harbor town of Grand Marais they can help you sell or purchase BWCAW and Superior National Forest area properties, and along the rugged Lake Superior coast. In addition, they can help you with properties in NW Ontario through associations with brokers there.
task: Mike Raymond of Red Pine needed a have Red Pine Realty's website transferred to a new host after a change in developers and expensive hosting costs. I transferred, and updated Red Pine Realty's website to a new host while maintaining the same design with a few design and on-page search engine optimizations.
