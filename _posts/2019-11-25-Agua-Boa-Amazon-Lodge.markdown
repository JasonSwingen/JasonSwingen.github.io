description: A fly fishing lodge located on the Amazon River in Agua Boa Brazil. Fly-fishermen from around the world have been astounded and charmed by the spectacular and unspoiled rain forest surroundings and of course also by the ultimate fly-fishing experience of sight-fishing for the jungle’s fiercest fighting fish, the Peacock Bass. In addition to the Peacock Bass, fishermen can fish for the now plentiful Pirarucu, the Piranha, the Aruana, the Pacu, and the countless other species that inhabit the Agua Boa.
task: Built a brand new website featuring immersive media in able to showcase the beauty and adventure filled waters of the Amazon River. The website features social media integration, responsive design and full featured videos, photos galleries, fishing reports, and more.
