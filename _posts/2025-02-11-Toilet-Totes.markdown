description: Manufactured by North Shore Medical LLC, the FDA registered, dually patented Toilet Tote™ is a disposable plastic container seamlessly fitting into nearly all portable commode chairs. In addition to its “ease of use” for the patient and care provider, the Toilet Tote™ replaces the bucket where dangerous patient “ricochet” or “splash” events can spread common infections frequently found in hospitals and care facilities. It also serves as a first line of defense for suspected, but undiagnosed illnesses, such as C-Diff.
task: After losing a previous web developer, the owner of Toilet Totes needed a responsible developer that can update his website. Many updates being made to improve the UI and UX of the website that will give visitors a clear and consistent message.
