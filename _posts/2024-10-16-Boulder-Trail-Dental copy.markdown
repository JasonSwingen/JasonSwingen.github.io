description: Drs. Meaghan Morrell-Huot and Jeffrey Polzin have formed an independent entity, focused on you and your family. As an independent practice, team, resources, and attention will all be in one place. Their focus has always been based on your needs and we will continue to provide you all the services you have relied on, and more. Their practice philosophy is like trail etiquette in how we treat others as we meet them along the way and it guides us in your dental care.
task: After starting a new dental practice in Hermantown, MN, Drs. Meaghan Morrell-Huot and Jeffrey Polzin reached out to get a new website built for their dental practice. Located near the Boulder Trail in Hermantown they wanted their website to reflect both a clean and natural site to reflect on their practice's philosophy.
