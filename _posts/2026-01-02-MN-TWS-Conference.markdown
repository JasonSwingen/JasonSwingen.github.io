description: The MN Chapter of The Wildlife Society, organized in 1944, subscribes to the principles set forth by The Wildlife Society. Our chapter objectives are to ensure the management of wildlife resources on a sound biological basis that benefits ecosystems and people, and to encourage the highest possible professional standards in those working with wildlife resources.
task: >
  Originally the Minnesota Chapter of The Wildlife Society hired us to build a website for their annual conference. After the event's success, the chapter asked us to redesign and rebuild their full site to better promote meetings, conferences, awards, and professional development opportunities. We delivered a responsive, mobile-friendly site with a clear events calendar, an easy-to-update CMS, registration and contact forms, and optimized content to improve visibility and member engagement.
