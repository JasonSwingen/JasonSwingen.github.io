description: Zenith Health Advocates is a professional health advocacy service. Their mission is to simplify healthcare decisions and ensure dignified, coordinated, quality health care so seniors and their families can spend time on the things that really matter. Healthcare for seniors is often complex, fragmented and confusing. Unfortunately, care is often not patient-centered, placing the burden on seniors and families to coordinate care and ensure communication between providers. But you can’t know what you don’t know. Zenith Health Advocates will partner with you and your family so you can feel confident and in control of your healthcare. Based in Duluth, Minnesota, we provide personalized, evidence-based support to help you cut through the often-confusing healthcare system, make informed decisions and get the best care possible. Whether you’re facing a new diagnosis, struggling with overwhelming medical bills, or simply need an expert by your side, we will advocate for you and your goals at every step.
task: Sarah started a new Health Advocacy business based in Duluth Minnesota to help simplify the complex healthcare system. She needed a new custom website that allowed her potential customers to find her and learn more about her business.
