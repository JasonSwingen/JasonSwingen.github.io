I took a trip out to the north shore again mainly looking for Kamloops. I went up to the mouth of the French River and it was packed with fisherman. After a few casts and seeing that none of the other 50 anglers were catching anything I decided to move on. I moved further north up the shore and switched from casting a looper bug under a casting bobber to through my favorite 2/5 oz orange and gold Lil Cleo. I usually cast out as far as I can and count to six to let the spoon get down to the correct depth. One cast as soon as I started reeling in after my count I had a fish on. My very first Coho Salmon.
