description: Norwegian Flyfishers Club is a full accommodation guiding service located on the Gaula River in Norway.
task: This project was put together with the partnership of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.instagram.com/theflyfishingnation">The Fly Fishing Nation</a> to create a completely new redesigned website for the Norwegian Flyfishers Club. The goal of the new website was to have a simple, and earthy feel, while modern features such as a fully responsive design with social media integration will showcase the power and the beauty of the Gaula.
