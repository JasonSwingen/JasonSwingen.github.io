## My favorite Sublime Text Plugins

Lets just get things rolling. Here is a list of my currently used and favorite Sublime Text Plugins. I am currently running Sublime Text 3 on Windows 8.1.

* Package Control
* Emmet
* Jekyll
* Bracket Highlighter
* Front End Snippets
* Cobalt2 Color Theme

### Package Control

I had to come back to put this in first. I often forget that package control doesn't come pre-installed with sublime text, because without it everything is so much more difficult to do.

### Emmet

Emmet is my favorite plugin. I have only used it for a few months, but it feels like it has already saved me months of work. Instead of individually typing out every single opening tag and closing tag in html, you simply have to type the tag you want, press tab and your tag is written out for you as well as placing your curser in the middle. For tags that have attributes like links the href is automatically added and your curser is placed in the href quotes ready for your url. My favorite use for Emmet is ordered and unordered lists. Just type ul>li*10 and hit tab and your have an unordered list with ten items ready to go!

### Jekyll

I honestly just installed jekyll and haven't used it very much. I haven't gotten all of its functionality figured out, but so far just the post and draft creation has been very helpful.
