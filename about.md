I am a Front-End Web Developer and Internet Marketer specializing in Search Engine Optimization, Adwords, and Analytics. I went to college at Minnesota State University Moorhead, in Moorhead MN to study Marketing and Management. I received my Bachelor of Science in Both Marketing and Business Administration with an emphasis in Management, and also received a minor in Music.

I have always had an interest with computers, and first believed I would be a computer programmer in 6th grade. I have used both Mac OS-X and Microsoft Windows, and used a large amount of different software and taken college courses in software such as, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, and Access. I've also used Apple's iWork Suite, Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, Google's Adword Offline Editor, Screaming Frog SEO Spider, Prepros, Filezilla, and many others. I've taken college classes in Python, and C++, but most coding I do currently involves HTML, CSS (SCSS), and Jquery. Since the start of this blog I have started writing in Markup (what this page is currently written in). I consider myself a front-end developer, because that is what I prefer to spend my time doing, but I have also used the Contact Management System, Wordpress.

I grew up in Montana (on the flat side, not the mountainous side) and lived there until I was 19. After going to College in Minnesota I moved to North Carolina to be with my girlfriend Morgan. North Carolina is a great place, but there is nothing like the great midwest! After a few years in NC we moved back up to the great Northland. I am currently living in Duluth, Minnesota with my beautiful wife Morgan, goofy dog Bocadillo, and angry cat Whisker Biscuit.

Thanks for reading!
