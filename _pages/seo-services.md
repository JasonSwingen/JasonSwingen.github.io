### Case study — JS Outdoors (sample)

**Challenge:** JS Outdoors had inconsistent organic traffic and a slow homepage that caused high bounce rates. They needed targeted content and technical fixes to improve rankings and engagement.

**Approach:** Performed a technical SEO audit, implemented on-page keyword improvements focused on high-intent search phrases, restructured navigation for conversions, and improved page speed (image optimization and caching).

**Outcome:** Organic sessions increased by ~82% over three months; page load time improved from ~4.2s to ~1.8s.
