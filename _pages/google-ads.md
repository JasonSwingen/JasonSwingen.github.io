Drive immediate, targeted traffic with Google Ads campaigns tailored to Duluth audiences and the keywords that matter (including "Web Design Duluth"). I build measurable campaigns that focus on clicks that convert — landing pages, tracking, and iterative optimization.

### Services I provide

- Account setup & audit (structure, conversion tracking, analytics integration)
- Local keyword research and geo-targeted campaigns for Duluth and surrounding areas
- Ad copywriting and A/B testing to maximize click-through and conversion rates
- Custom landing pages optimized for conversion and SEO synergy (tie into Web Design Duluth pages)
- Bid & budget management to maximize ROI (manual + automated rules)
- Remarketing and audience layering to re-engage interested visitors
- Transparent reporting with clear KPIs (CTR, conversions, CPL, ROAS)

### Why pair Google Ads with SEO

- Ads deliver immediate visibility while organic SEO improves long-term rankings
- Use Ads data to surface high-intent keywords to prioritize for on-page SEO (e.g., "Web Design Duluth")
- Combine paid and organic presence to dominate search real estate and increase trust

### Case study — Local Web Design Campaign (sample)

**Challenge:** A Duluth web design client needed more qualified leads quickly while their SEO improvements matured. The site had inconsistent landing pages and no conversion tracking.

**Approach:** Built a geo-targeted campaign focused on high-intent keywords like "Web Design Duluth" and "Duluth web designer", created tailored landing pages, set up conversion tracking and remarketing lists, and iteratively optimized bids and ad copy.

**Outcome:** 60% increase in conversions month-over-month, a 26% drop in cost-per-lead, and high-quality leads that translated into booked calls.
